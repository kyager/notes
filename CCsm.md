## Information Security Concepts and Governance

Security supports business needs
- Provides assurance to management

Security consists of people, technology, and physical / environmental

### Governance

Laws -> Strategy Mission / Goals -> Policy -> Procedures

- Governance creates accountability
- Oversight
- Leadership
    - Commuinication and support for policy and procedures (making the theory "real")

### Information Assurance

- Assurance is achieved through good practices
    - Including security
- Data and information are two of the most valuable assets of most organizations
    - Data must be protected throughout the data lifecycle
        - In all forms
        - At all times
        - In all places

### Purpose of Information Assurance / Security

- Comply with laws and regulations
- Privacy
    - PII (personally identifiable information)
    - PHI (protected health information)
    - GDPR (general data protection requirements)
    - HIPAA
    - Financial
    - GLBA, SOx
- Support business goals

### Elements of security

- People
- Technology
- Physical / Environmental

The "right" people doing the "right" things in the "right" way.

### Policies

- Provide direction
    - Mandates what is and is not allowed
- Signed by management
    - Example: Acceptable use policy

### Procedures

- Mandates how something should be done
    - Example: Provisioning new user access
    - Step-by-step actions
- Enforce the intent of policy

### Standards

- Mandate required solutions
    - Equipment purchases
    - Compliance with good practices
        - ISO/IEC 27001 compliance

### Baselines

Mandate minimum acceptable levels of action

- Equipment configuration
- Minimum password length

### Guidelines

Recommendations not mandatory

- How to select a good password

### Key points

A policy is of no value if it is not supported by instructions of what to do and how to do it.

The security policy demonstrates management's commitment to the information security program.

### The information security triad

#### CIA

Used to define a complex term like "security" in a menaningful way.

- Confidentiality
    - Protecting information from improper disclosure
        - Privacy
            - Employee and customer data
        - Secrecy
            - Trade secrets
            - Research
            - Marketing plans
- Integrity
    - Preserving accuracy and data processing
    - Propection from improper modification
        - Unathorized users
        - Users performing unauthorized functions
        - Authorized entities
            - Ensuring that only authorized entities can access or modify data
                - Authentication
                    - Examined in domain three: access controls
                    - Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
                    - Do not trust a single authentication technique
- Availability
    - Ensuring that systems and data are accesible when required
    - Protection from destruction
        - Backups
    - Loss of access
        - DDoS attacks
        - Cut cables / equipment failure
        - Redundancy

#### Non-repudiation

> Protection against an individual who falsely denies having performed a certain action and provides the capability to dtermine whether an individual took a certain action, such as creating information, sending a message, approving information, or receing a message.
>> <cite>NIST SP800-53 r5</cite>

## Risk Management

Risk is defined as the probability of an event and it's consequence.

> Information security risk is the potential that a given threat will exploit vulnerabilities of an asset or group of assets and thereby cause harm to the organization
>> <cite>ISO/IEC 27005</cite>

- Before understanding risk, you need to understand the business you're in

### Risk identification

- Determine
    - Asset value
    - Threats
    - Vulnerabilites
- Document controls
- Understand the consequences of risk events

### Risk identification requirements

- Assets
- Threats
- Vulnerabilities
- Likelihood/probabilities
- Impact/consequence
    - Not all events will have the same impact

### Risk assessment/analysis results

- Prioritization
- Recommended actions (response)
- Determine risk owner
- Generate risk assessment report
- Update risk register

### Key points

- Risk management consists of saeveral activities that may happen concurrently and consecutively
    - Establishing context seeks to understand the organization
    - Risk assessment identifies and prioritizes risk
    - IT risk is a subset of organizational risk
